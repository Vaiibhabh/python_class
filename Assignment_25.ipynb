    "Ans. Iterators: When iterating through iterable objects like lists, tuples, sets, etc., an iterator is an object with a countable number of values. It follows the principle of lazy evaluation, where the evaluation of the expression will be put on hold and stored in memory until the item is specifically called, helping us to avoid repeated evaluation. Iterators are implemented using a class, and a local variable for iterating is not required here. As soon as lazy evaluation is applied, only one memory location is needed to process a value, which reduces RAM wastage and eliminates the need to load the full dataset at once when employing a large dataset.\n",

    "2.The iterable object's next element can be called with the keyword next().\n",
    "3.Reassign them to the same object in order to reuse them after the iterable object has been finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator: Another straightforward method of producing iterators uses the keyword \"yield\" rather than returning it from a predefined function. A function is used to implement generators. Generators use the same principles of lazy evaluation as iterators. The yield function in this case just returns the data without changing or terminating the function. As they won't store the complete sequence in memory, it will return a sequence of data in an iterable format that we must iterate over in order to use the data.\n"
